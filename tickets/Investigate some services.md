My most used services didn't change from last year:

- [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) is my document management system (also for family/friends with vpn) ðŸ¥‡
    
- [Adguard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) is my DNS Server and blocker (also for family/friends at home)
    
- [Timetagger](https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger) is a quite simple time tracking (also for colleagues, I miss a password reset feature)
    
- [ChangeDetection](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io) I receive a notification when something on a website is changing (also for family/friends)
    
- [Plausible](https://plausible.deployn.de/sites) Google Analytics without Google
    

Other notable mentions (I use regularly): - Code Server (VSCode in the browser, sadly without SSH) - Different CMSs (WordPress, Ghost, Directus) - Synology Photos (is Immich better?) - Comentario (similar to Commento++, but more features and active development) - Wireguard (VPN) - I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
